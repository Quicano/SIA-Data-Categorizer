<text top="368" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">I was asked to introduce Glyne at the 2011 MOT conference given in Glyne Piggott’s honour and</text>
<text top="388" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">have now been asked to write an introduction to the collection of papers from that conference. At</text>
<text top="409" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">the end of this short introduction to the introduction, I have put my cheat sheet for the original</text>
<text top="429" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">introduction given in May. What I have to add here is the summary of what happened at that</text>
<text top="449" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">conference. Again, I will let the papers speak for themselves and comment on the academic impact</text>
<text top="470" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">that Glyne has had on several generations of phonologists. What can’t be replicated in this volume</text>
<text top="490" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">is the warmth of that weekend last May. In the audience were students spanning four decades</text>
<text top="510" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">and several continents, colleagues, friends, and family members – wife, two daughters and two</text>
<text top="531" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">granddaughters. Most of the conference papers began with Glyne anecdotes and many speeches</text>
<text top="551" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">were made at the evening dinner. What was special was that when anyone reminisced, others would</text>
<text top="571" left="135" width="449" height="15" font="3">be nodding in agreement. We all shared that same Glyne experience.</text>
<text top="592" left="160" width="623" height="15" font="3">Perhaps because I began as Glyne’s student and feel like I’m still learning from him, I feel that</text>
<text top="612" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">his students had a special connection. We all remembered being pushed to what we felt was beyond</text>
<text top="633" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">our limits, only to find that we had set our sights too low. One student talked of being told to trash</text>
<text top="653" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">the last chapter of her thesis just weeks before she was supposed to submit. She was extremely</text>
<text top="673" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">angry at the time, but having redone the chapter, realized that she had been forced to stretch and the</text>
<text top="694" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">thesis was better for it. Her response was – how did he know that she had a better thesis in her when</text>
<text top="714" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">she didn’t know that herself. We never felt belittled only challenged, and since he felt that we were</text>
<text top="734" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">capable of better things, we only pushed harder. His daughter, Nicole, summed up what we all felt</text>
<text top="755" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">– he listens without judgment. He provides a safe environment to try out new thoughts. He might</text>
<text top="775" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">not like an idea, he might think something was headed in the wrong direction, but we were never</text>
<text top="795" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">made to feel wrong or lacking, just temporarily off course. And more importantly, we felt we were</text>
<text top="816" left="135" width="276" height="15" font="3">in good hands, that we had a caring guide.</text>
<text top="836" left="160" width="623" height="15" font="3">Glyne has produced countless papers on phonology, he has created a vast literature on Ojibwe,</text>
<text top="857" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">but he has also inspired a small army of linguists that span the globe. Through his actions as much</text>
<text top="877" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">as his teaching, we have learned about linguistics from him and we have learned about life from</text>
<text top="897" left="135" width="202" height="15" font="3">him. And we are very grateful.</text>

<text top="179" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">talk. I was paralyzed at the thought of summing up 33 years of knowing Glyne, summing up my</text>
<text top="199" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">relationship with Glyne, and summing up Glyne himself. Once I realized that this was not going</text>
<text top="220" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">to possible, it became doable. So I’m going to give a brief history of my various interactions with</text>
<text top="240" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">Glyne, not to be selfish but I believe this history, or at least parts of it, parallels the history of many</text>
<text top="260" left="135" width="83" height="15" font="3">in this room.</text>
<text top="285" left="160" width="623" height="15" font="3">First off, as a syntactician, it’s best if I leave it to others to talk about the impact that his research</text>
<text top="305" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">has had on the world of phonology and we have already seen it amply referred to in the talks and</text>
<text top="326" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">posters here. But as someone who has known Glyne as his student, his colleague, for a brief while</text>
<text top="346" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">his chair, and most recently his co-investigator and co-author, I still feel qualified to present a side</text>
<text top="366" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">of Glyne that we have all come to appreciate as much as we appreciate his academic side. The true</text>
<text top="387" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">testimony to Glyne as a person is represented in this room now. First and most importantly, he is a</text>
<text top="407" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">family man and that spills over into his academic life. We all feel special and we are all here because</text>
<text top="427" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">he has made us part of his larger family and treated us as we would treat a family member – with</text>
<text top="448" left="135" width="110" height="15" font="3">love and respect.</text>
<text top="472" left="160" width="623" height="15" font="3">I first came to know Glyne in 1978 when I was his student. This was when Nikki and Adrian</text>
<text top="493" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">were young and Sydney and Gaby far off in the future. This is the picture of him at that time accom-</text>

<text top="533" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">I had come to McGill to be a sociolin-</text>
<text top="554" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">guist and within two weeks of Glyne’s</text>
<text top="574" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">class, I was a die-hard phonologist.</text>
<text top="594" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">Anyone who has had Glyne in class</text>
<text top="615" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">knows the excitement that he conveys.</text>
<text top="635" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">One recent student of Glyne’s described</text>
<text top="655" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">his class presentation as a dance — he</text>
<text top="676" left="520" width="203" height="15" font="3">moves, he dips, he gestures.</text>
<text top="676" left="741" width="42" height="15" font="3">In the</text>
<text top="696" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">late 70s he was famous for wearing</text>
<text top="716" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">dark woolen turtlenecks, which would</text>
<text top="737" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">be covered in chalkdust by the end of the</text>
<text top="757" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">class. I’m not sure what changed first</text>
<text top="777" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">– Glyne’s style of dressing or dustless</text>
<text top="798" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">chalk, but this is not so much of his per-</text>
<text top="818" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">sona today. But he IS the master of the</text>
<text top="838" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">pregnant pause. It involves a bit of eye-</text>
<text top="859" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">brow raising, intense staring, until ev-</text>
<text top="879" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">eryone is in attention and then he reveals</text>
<text top="899" left="520" width="201" height="15" font="3">something magical or probing.</text>
<text top="924" left="545" width="238" height="15" font="3">I should stress that being his student</text>
<text top="944" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">wasn’t an easy ride. I received the lowest</text>
<text top="965" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">grades of my career from him – I still</text>
<text top="985" left="520" width="264" height="15" font="3">remember the 78 he gave me on my first</text>
<text top="1005" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">paper. But this is where another side of Glyne comes in. When he pushes you, you feel honoured</text>
<text top="1026" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">to be pushed. When he sets the bar high, you feel that he respects you enough to believe that</text>

<text top="179" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">you can clear it. Breaching confidentiality here, I will tell you that when I was Acting Chair for a</text>
<text top="199" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">year I was privy to both his grades and his teaching evaluations. There are those who believe that</text>
<text top="220" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">teachers who push their students and who are severe graders are punished when it comes to teaching</text>
<text top="240" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">evaluations. Glyne is a counter-example. I have never seen such low grades so highly rewarded.</text>
<text top="260" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">What is his secret? For me it comes down to the basic respect for and commitment to his students</text>
<text top="281" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">– and this, in fact, is what I appreciate most about Glyne both within and outside of academia. He</text>
<text top="301" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">genuinely loves people and he genuinely loves ideas. He has the insight and the optimism necessary</text>
<text top="321" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">to see the best in a person and the best in an idea and, more importantly, he has the talent to work</text>
<text top="342" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">through and bring that best out. In the world of academics where hyper-criticism can be masked as</text>
<text top="362" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">standards and intellect, Glyne has the grace to give both people and ideas the benefit of the doubt</text>
<text top="382" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">and, where needed, a second chance. When he disagrees, it is supposed to be the starting point of a</text>
<text top="403" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">conversation, not the endpoint. As any good father, he taught me this through modeling, and when</text>
<text top="423" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">I forget, which I do, I’m lucky enough to have him nearby as a reminder. There are many people</text>
<text top="443" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">in this room that are a product of this enthusiasm, support, and generosity. Not the least of which</text>
<text top="464" left="135" width="648" height="15" font="3">are an amazing pair of daughters and an amazing pair of granddaughters – for which I also credit</text>
<text top="484" left="135" width="230" height="15" font="3">Sylvia. Theirs is a true partnership.</text>
<text top="504" left="324" width="459" height="15" font="3">When I left McGill I also left phonology and was hired back here as</text>
<text top="524" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">a syntactician, and as Glyne’s colleague. I was very happily a pure syn-</text>
<text top="545" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">tactician for many years, but one should never underestimate the power of</text>
<text top="565" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">Glyne’s infectious enthusiasm. About five years ago, he started dropping</text>
<text top="585" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">into my office to talk about Ojibwe phonology and morphology with both</text>
<text top="606" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">the phonology and the morphology couched in syntactic terms. He basi-</text>
<text top="626" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">cally had me at ‘phase edge’. And the rest is not so much history as present</text>
<text top="646" left="299" width="27" height="15" font="3">day.</text>
<text top="667" left="324" width="459" height="15" font="3">So we turn to Glyne today. Glyne now retired, coming in to the office</text>
<text top="687" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">more than I do, and not only NOT slowing down but striking out in new</text>
<text top="707" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">directions which I assume we will hear about shortly. Glyne who is will-</text>
<text top="728" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">ing to worry about Edge Features, Bare Phrase Structure, and numeration</text>
<text top="748" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">workspaces. I remember him telling me many years ago that he would stop</text>
<text top="768" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">being a phonologist if they got rid of rule ordering. Luckily for all of us,</text>
<text top="789" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">he is much more amenable to new ideas than he professes to be. We all</text>
<text top="809" left="299" width="177" height="15" font="3">have a lesson to learn here.</text>
<text top="829" left="324" width="459" height="15" font="3">This second picture is actually one that I took on one of our an-</text>
<text top="850" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">nual departmental apple-picking excursions – where Glyne was not</text>
<text top="870" left="299" width="447" height="15" font="3">only an eager participant but often the initiator and organizer.</text>
<text top="870" left="766" width="17" height="15" font="3">So</text>
<text top="890" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">this is how I like to think of Glyne because even though I have</text>
<text top="911" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">moved from student to junior colleague to co-author, I still and</text>
<text top="931" left="299" width="485" height="15" font="3">will always, even without the aid of a ladder, be looking up to</text>
